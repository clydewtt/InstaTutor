# InstaTutor

## Inspiration
As the world becomes increasingly technologically advanced, people are increasingly wanting on-demand services. Several other services are on-demand such as Instacart, and even health services, so why not extend the reach to education?

## What it does
InstaTutor pairs the user (student) with a fellow student tutor in the subject or topic chosen. If the user chooses Computer Science, then a computer science tutor would be looked for by the app. If a tutor is found, then the user will be transferred to a call with the tutor.

## How we built it
I built this app with Android Studio, Figma, Firebase, and Jitsi Meet Integration.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult implementing the video calling feature at first, I was terribly confused. Also, I wanted to implement device-to-device notifications, but I wasn't able to, due to time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of building this MVP product in a mere couple of hours. This was a lot of work, and I'm satisfied with how it came out in relation to the time spent on it.

## What we learned
I now know how to implement video calling on Android and mobile devices. I also learned that next time, I should probably work on a team due to the workload.

## What's next for InstaTutor
Fully implementing the notifications feature would be next so that the other people can securely join a meeting and so that several people would be able to join different meetings at once.
